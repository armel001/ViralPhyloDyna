Job 1: 
        Concatenating query and background fasta files
	
Reason: Missing output files: results/fasta_concatenation/msa_alpha.fasta

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files:
results/fasta_concatenation/report_alpha.txt (missing locally)
MissingOutputException in rule fasta_concatenation in file /Users/armel001/Documents/Workflow_template/workflow/rules/data_prep.smk, line 2:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/fasta_concatenation/report_alpha.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: msa_alpha.fasta)
