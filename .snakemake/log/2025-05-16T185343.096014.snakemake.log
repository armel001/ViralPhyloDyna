Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

Removing output files of failed job treetime_mugration since they might be corrupted:
results/05_Treetime_mugration/alpha_tree
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
