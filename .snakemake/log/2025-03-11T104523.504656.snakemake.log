MissingOutputException in rule treetime_ancestral in file /Users/armel001/Documents/Workflow_template/workflow/rules/treetime_ancestral.smk, line 1:
Job 7  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/treetime_ancestral/alpha_tree/timetree.nexus (missing locally, parent dir contents: auspice_tree.json, root_to_tip_regression.pdf, trace_run.log, dates.tsv, branch_mutations.txt, ancestral_sequences.fasta, molecular_clock.txt, sequence_evolution_model.txt, divergence_tree.nexus, timetree.pdf, outliers.tsv)
Removing output files of failed job treetime_ancestral since they might be corrupted:
results/treetime_ancestral/alpha_tree
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
