Job 5: 
        Building a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE
        
Reason: Code has changed since last execution

RuleException in rule initial_tree in file /Users/armel001/Documents/Workflow_template/workflow/rules/data_anal_tree.smk, line 4:
NameError: The name 'sample' is unknown in this context. Did you mean 'wildcards.sample'?, when formatting the following:

        mkdir -p results/{sample}_phylogenetic_tree
        iqtree -s {input.msa_aligned_trimmed} -fast -m MF -alrt 1000 -nt AUTO > {log} 2>&1
        mv {input.msa_aligned_trimmed}.* results/{sample}_phylogenetic_tree/
        echo "Phylogenetic tree completed for {wildcards.sample}" >> {log}
