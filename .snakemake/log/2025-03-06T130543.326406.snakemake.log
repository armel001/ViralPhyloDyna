Job 5: 
        Building a phylogenetic tree using IQ-TREE
        
Reason: Missing output files: results/phylogenetic_tree/alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.treefile; Code has changed since last execution

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files:
results/phylogenetic_tree/alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.treefile (missing locally)
MissingOutputException in rule initial_tree in file /Users/armel001/Documents/Workflow_template/workflow/rules/data_anal_tree.smk, line 4:
Job 5  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/phylogenetic_tree/alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.treefile (missing locally, parent dir contents: alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.log, alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.ckp.gz, alpha_tree, alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.iqtree, alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.parstree, alpha_aligned_trimmed.fasta.model.gz)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
