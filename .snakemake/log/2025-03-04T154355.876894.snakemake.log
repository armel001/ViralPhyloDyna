Job 2: 
        Aligning the concatenated FASTA file
        
Reason: Forced execution

RuleException:

Removing output files of failed job alignment since they might be corrupted:
results/alignment/alpha_aligned.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
