Job 1: 
        Concatenating query and background fasta files
	
Reason: Missing output files: results/fasta_concatenation/msa_alpha.fasta

Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files:
results/fasta_concatenation/report_alpha.txt (missing locally)
MissingOutputException in rule fasta_concatenation in file /Users/armel001/Documents/Workflow_template/workflow/rules/data_prep.smk, line 2:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 60 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/fasta_concatenation/report_alpha.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: msa_alpha.fasta)
